# chrome-pie
## (work in progress)
You deserve access to your device
## What it is / Info
> A jailbreak for chromeos to bypass admin privileges. This works on your school managed chromebook too!
> The wrapper is made in C

## How to use it!

> You will need to buy an raspberry pi pico and you can get one for like 8 USD from microcenter. Check [`INSTALL.md`](https://github.com/KevinAlavik/chrome-pie/blob/main/INSTALL.md) for instructions on how to install it and build it.

## Why do you need an raspberry pi pico?

> If something like your school is managing your chromebook then you probably dont have full disk access or linux access. So we need like an "middle man" that sends and edits data on the targets side!

**And im like 80% sure you cant do this via bluethooth sadly**
## If i do have linux access?

> Then you dont need to buy an raspberry you can just run `linux.sh` and your device should be restarted when its done!
