# How to use it!

##### MAKE SURE YOUR DEVICE IS JAILBROKEN OTHERWISE THIS WONT WORK (to jailbreak check `INSTALL.md`

## Check if your device is jailbroken

To check if your jailbroken click the "search" key on your chromebook (the magnifying glass) then search for "pie" and if you see an app called "Chrome Pie" then you should be good to go.

## Using pie to enable linux

Launch **Chrome Pie** and under **tools** there should be an option to enable linux. Press that and then press **apply** and your device should restart. 

To see if it worked go into settings > advanced > developers > "Linux development environment". This button that was gray before should be blue. Then just click **Turn on** and follow the steps.
