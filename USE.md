# How to use it!

##### Make sure your device is jailbroken otherwise this wont work (to jailbreak check `INSTALL.md`

## Check if your device is jailbroken

To check if your jailbroken click the "search" key on your chromebook (the magnifying glass) then search for "pie" and if you see an app called "Chrome Pie" then you should be good to go.

#### You need to have the pico (or your prefered device, with pie installed and compiled success fully on it) to enable any tweaks (for now)

## Using pie to enable linux 

Launch **Chrome Pie** and under **tools** there should be an option to enable linux. Press that and then press **apply** and your device should restart. 

To see if it worked go into settings > advanced > developers > "Linux development environment". This button that was gray before should be blue. Then just click **Turn on** and follow the steps.

*My button is grayed out beacuse my device isnt jailbroken (yet) (this is not one of my test devices)

## How do i know if my device got reseted (un jailbroken)?

Sadly your device has a chance of getting unjailbroken but to check if you are unjailbroken just click the "search" key on your chromebook (the magnifying glass) then search for "pie" and if you see an app called "Chrome Pie" then you should still be jailbroken. 

If its not there then sadly you are jailbroken, just rejailbreak and your good, all of your old settings should be there.

### You might have the app but you are still unjailbroken

To check if you are still jailbroken go into the app and under **debug** press the **check jailbreak status** if you are still jailbroken you will get an return saying "**Your device is still jailbroken**" if its unjailbroken then it will say "**Your device got reseted, please rejailbreak it**"

### You need the pico (or your prefered device, with pie installed and compiled success fully on it) to rejailbreak. The app cant make any changes to the file system and other data (for now, working on an bypass)
